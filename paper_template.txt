\begin{abstract}
We propose a novel approach to model contextual meaning change in natural language processing by drawing inspiration from general relativity. Our method treats meaning spaces as Riemannian manifolds where context induces curvature, enabling dynamic semantic relationships through geodesic distances. We implement this using modified transformer attention mechanisms with learnable metric tensors. Experimental results on contextual similarity tasks show improvements of {{IMPROVEMENT_COSIMLX}}\% on CoSimLex and {{IMPROVEMENT_SCWS}}\% on SCWS over BERT baselines, while maintaining competitive performance on GLUE benchmarks ({{GLUE_AVERAGE}} average score). Our geometric interpretation provides new insights into how context shapes meaning in neural language models.

\section{Introduction}

The phenomenon of contextual meaning change poses fundamental challenges for natural language understanding. Traditional word embeddings represent words as fixed points in vector spaces, failing to capture how meaning dynamically shifts with context. While contextualized models like BERT \citep{devlin2018bert} partially address this through attention mechanisms, they lack explicit geometric interpretation of how context influences semantic relationships.

We propose a novel geometric framework inspired by general relativity, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item Flat semantic spaces represent context-independent meanings
\item Curved semantic spaces capture context-dependent meaning changes
\item Geodesic distances provide more accurate semantic similarity measures
\end{itemize}

Our key contributions include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A geometric formulation of contextual meaning change using Riemannian manifolds
\item Efficient implementation through modified transformer attention with learnable metric tensors
\item Empirical validation showing improved performance on contextual similarity tasks
\item Theoretical framework connecting differential geometry with natural language processing
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Contextualized Word Representations}
Contextualized embeddings from models like ELMo \citep{peters2018deep}, BERT \citep{devlin2018bert}, and GPT \citep{radford2018improving} have revolutionized NLP by capturing context-dependent meanings. However, these approaches lack explicit geometric interpretation of how context shapes semantic relationships.

\subsection{Geometric Deep Learning}
Recent work has explored geometric structures in neural networks \citep{bronstein2017geometric}, including hyperbolic embeddings for hierarchical data \citep{nickel2017poincare} and manifold learning techniques. Our work extends these ideas to model dynamic semantic changes in language.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Geometric Framework}

We model the semantic space as a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ where the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ encodes how context influences meaning relationships. The metric is decomposed as:

\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu}(x) = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}(\text{context})
\end{equation}

where $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ represents the flat background metric (context-independent semantics) and $h_{\mu\nu}(\text{context})$ captures context-induced curvature.

\subsection{Modified Attention Mechanism}

We modify the standard transformer attention to incorporate the geometric structure:

\begin{equation}
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}(Q G^{-1} K^T) V
\end{equation}

where $G$ is the learnable metric tensor derived from context embeddings.

\subsection{Geodesic Distance Computation}

Semantic similarity is computed using geodesic distances on the curved manifold:

\begin{equation}
d_g(x_1, x_2) = \inf_{\gamma} \int_0^1 \sqrt{g_{\mu\nu}(\gamma(t)) \dot{\gamma}^\mu(t) \dot{\gamma}^\nu(t)} dt
\end{equation}

For computational efficiency, we use the first-order approximation for nearby points.

\section{Experimental Setup}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Geometric Analysis}

Figure \ref{fig:curvature} illustrates how context induces curvature in the semantic space, with stronger curvature corresponding to greater meaning shifts.

\section{Analysis and Discussion}

\subsection{Geometric Interpretation}

Our results demonstrate that modeling context as spacetime curvature provides a principled way to capture meaning changes. The learned metric tensors reveal how different types of context (syntactic, semantic, pragmatic) induce distinct geometric structures.

\subsection{Attention Pattern Analysis}

The geometric attention mechanism produces more interpretable attention patterns, with geodesic paths corresponding to meaningful semantic relationships.

\subsection{Limitations}

Current limitations include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Computational complexity of exact geodesic computation
\item Limited to first-order geometric approximations
\item Requires careful initialization of metric tensors
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

We have introduced a novel geometric framework for modeling contextual meaning change in language, inspired by general relativity. Our approach treats semantic spaces as Riemannian manifolds where context induces curvature, enabling more accurate similarity computation through geodesic distances. Experimental results show significant improvements on contextual similarity tasks while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Future work will explore higher-order geometric structures, more sophisticated curvature computations, and applications to multilingual contexts. The geometric perspective opens new research directions at the intersection of differential geometry and natural language processing.
